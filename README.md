# Edit-Me-Webserver

[![Python 3.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

**Edit-Me-Webserver** is a local webserver skeleton which handles GET and POST requests and uses a simple flat-file data store written in pure python. It is meant as an introduction to webserver development in python.

## Getting Started

1. Download the [Python 3 installer](https://www.python.org/downloads). I reccomend the most recent version, but note that this project has only been tested on Python 3.8.0

2. Run the installer. All the default settings are fine and these settings can always be modified in the future.

3. Download the Edit-Me-Webserver code from github. Clone or Download > Download Zip. Unzip the file to wherever you'd like.

## Running and Editing

**Run the webserver:** Locate the `webserver.py` file and click on it to open it with Python. A black box should open up indicating that the webserver is running.

**Look at the website:** By default, the server's address is `http://localhost:8080`. Just type this into a web browser and have a look at the site.

**Stop the webserver:** Right now the only way to stop the server is by closing the window it's running in. Find the black python text window and close it.

*Start Editing!* Open any of the files in a text editor to look at the code and start editing. I reccomend an editor such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads) which is well suited to simple code editing.
